# C-Compiler and SIC Assembler Project

## Overview

This project consists of two main components: a C-compiler focusing on `while` loops and a SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) assembler. The C-compiler translates C code with `while` loops into an intermediate representation, while the SIC assembler converts SIC assembly code into object programs.

### Components

1. **C-Compiler**: 
   - Focuses on parsing and interpreting `while` loops in C code.
   - Includes syntax analysis, intermediate code generation, and LR parsing.

2. **SIC Assembler**:
   - Reads SIC assembly code, generates symbol tables, and produces object programs.
   - Includes example SIC assembly programs and the assembler source code.

## Detailed Documentation

For more detailed information on each component, please refer to the respective README files:

- [C-Compiler README](Compiler/readme.md)
- [SIC Assembler README](sic/readme.md)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can follow the instructions provided in the individual README files for compiling and running the C-compiler and SIC assembler.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive example of a C-compiler focusing on `while` loops and a SIC assembler. By following the provided documentation, you can understand the structure and functionality of each component and run the provided examples.
